# YelpCamp - A Campground Review Website
[YelpCamp](https://blooming-harbor-84389.herokuapp.com/) is a website I developed from scratch where users can create and review campgrounds. To do so, a user must first have an account. This project was completed after finishing Colt Steele's web development course, [The Web Developer Bootcamp: 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap.

## My Vision
The purpose of [YelpCamp](https://blooming-harbor-84389.herokuapp.com/) is to build a base for developing and deploying machine learning applications. I plan to create the following machine learning applications:
* Sentiment classifier of campground reviews
* Text-generation for creating fake campgrounds
* Image recognition of user uploaded images

I welcome any suggestions or improvements to my site.
